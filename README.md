# Bite Metric — Product & UX Design

Bite Metric is a data-driven web application designed to help groups of friends decide where to eat by aggregating individual preferences into transparent, ranked recommendations.

This project focuses on **product thinking, UX design, and decision-support logic**, with an emphasis on usability, clarity, and explainable scoring.

## Problem
Group dining decisions are often inefficient and frustrating due to:
- Conflicting preferences
- Lack of transparency in recommendations
- Decision fatigue when comparing many options

## Solution
Bite Metric enables users to:
- Input individual dining preferences
- Apply constraints (dietary needs, price range, location)
- View ranked restaurant recommendations based on a clear “Fit Score”

The interface was designed to make the recommendation logic understandable and trustworthy.
